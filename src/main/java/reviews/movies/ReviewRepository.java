				"The best version to see is Blade Runner: The Final Cut  as the perfectionist director's definitive cut is called which is bleaker than the original but a more wonderfully immersive and true film.\r\n" + 
				"The film is based on Philip K Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and is set in Los Angeles. The 'hero' is a detective called Deckard (expertly played by Harrison Ford), who hunts down androids  in the film they are called replicants  who have escaped from their slave jails on outer-space colonies and are trying to blend in back on Earth. Rutger Hauer's android Roy Batty is one of the most dangerous, yet appealing, 'monsters' in cinema.\r\n" + 
				"There are some people who prefer the original's gritty Chandleresque voice-over narration and the ambiguous happy ending (both supposedly forced on Scott), but the Final Cut is a more disturbing tale of dehumanisation.\r\n" + 
				"Blade Runner was first released in 1982 Scott had wanted to film Blade Runner in Hong Kong but it was too expensive, so the bustling city and sky neon-lit by huge corporate logos and video billboards were shot mainly on Warner Brothers' back lot in Burbank, California, with the smoke pumped in and drizzling rain manufactured.\r\n" + 
				"Scott designed this world in tiny detail and shot it at night. He told the New York Times once: \"I'sve never paid quite so much attention to a movie, ever. But we had to create a world that supported the story's premise, made it believable. Why do you watch a film seven times? Because somebody's done it right and transported you to its world.\"\"\r\n" + 
				"Telegraph Film Critic Tim Robey, who included Blade Runner in his list of the 10 best sci-fi films of all time, has described the film as \"an extraordinary feat of cyberpunk design, wrapped around an equally extraordinary premise about replicants raging against the dying of the light. Harrison Ford's Deckard could easily be one of them  witness his unicorn dream in the Director's Cut.\"\r\n" + 
				"In February 2015, it was announced that Ford will return to star in a sequel to Blade Runner directed by Denis Villeneuve.\r\n" + 
				"Blade Runner: The Final Cut is a masterpiece of dystopian science fiction on film.");
		MovieReview HotFuzz = new MovieReview("Hot Fuzz","A skilled London police officer is transferred to a small town that's harbouring a dark secret.","2007","Edgar Wright","Comedy",2468544L,"HotFuzz.jpg", "A hilariously great mash-up of bad buddy cop action movies about a straight-edge cop (Simon Pegg) who is promoted and relocated to a mysterious town inhabited by strange people, and how he discovers there is more to the town than meets the eye. Pegg's performance is its usual stuff, absolutely outstanding and brilliant in many respects, with a buddy (Nick Frost) and bad guy (Timothy Dalton) that make this movie an awesome ride all the way through. The energy director Edgar Wright gives this movie thanks to his kinetic film-making style is absolutely infectious, and the result is an outstanding comedy with a dynamite conclusion that makes this film a must-see.");
		MovieReview It = new MovieReview("It", "A group of bullied kids band together when a shapeshifting demon, taking the appearance of a clown, begins hunting children.", "2017", "Andy Muschietti", "Horror",4562518L,"It.jpg", "Stephen King's It' is a ghoulishly unshackled update of the Maine author's coulorophobia book and it is superlative in every facet to the 1990 television miniseries which is now pitifully antiquated and meretricious in hindsight other than Tim Curry's baritone performance. By antedating the film from 1950's milieu to the 80's, the peripheral set decoration is chockfull of 'Gremlins' posters and a facetiously arcane reference to the \"Molly Ringwald\" of the group. It's catnip for the yuppie generation who were reared on Street Fighter arcade games and New Kids on the Block cassettes. Although scribes Chase Palmer, (defunct director) Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman are steeped in coming-of-age King staples (the mulleted bullies, the cluelessly clodhopper parents who vicariously haunt their children via Munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy, molestation, etc.), it is more of a neoclassical and old-fashioned nod than an assortment of hoary clichés. Usually the integration of special effects into Pennywise's (Bill Skarsgård) rakish appearances would be an eyesore but instead they annex a Stygian quality to his gangly movements such as when he is a contortionist out of the Well House fridge or when his jaw unhinges into serrated fangs. Luckily, the unanimously excellent Losers' Club isn't entirely expository about the Easter explosion and the delitescent backstory to the Pennywise's 27-year gap in his cannibalistic frenzy. However, the summer-vacationers cleaning up a sink bloodbath is lackluster to the magical-realism. As a presentational exhibition, each of Skarsgård's spooky happenings is a stinger than can be jaunty (a three-door choice of either Very Scary or Not Scary At All), a cheeky background nuance (a stentorian librarian lingering behind the focal point) or frightfully subliminal like a children's show which serenades Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) to slice his father's throat with a box-cutter.");
		MovieReview DieHard = new MovieReview("Die Hard", "John McClane, officer of the NYPD, tries to save his wife Holly Gennaro and several others that were taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.", "1988", "John McTiernan", "Action", 654813L, "DieHard.jpg", "When terrorists take the staff of a hi tec skyscraper hostage during a Christmas Eve party, a lone New York cop trapped in the building with them fights for survival while trying to foil their plans. Die Hard was a watershed moment in the evolution of the action movie, and was genre defying in that the heroes usually tended to have everything under control in action movies previous to this, while a blood soaked and desperate John McClane always seems one step away from defeat. This makes for some very suspenseful action and Willis' charismatic performance rightly elevated him to mega stardom. It has its faults, namely in the soapy back story of he and his wife and especially the ridiculous nonsense about his would be partner Al and his holstered pistol. These are minor points however as the quips are funny, the action beautifully choreographed and its a thrill ride that has dated surprisingly well. One of THE classic action movies.");
		MovieReview RomeoJuliet = new MovieReview("Romeo + Juliet", "Shakespeare's famous play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona still retaining its original dialogue.", "1996", "Baz Luhrmann", "Romance",5468188L, "RomeoJuliet.jpg", "Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis-Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from \"13 Reasons Why\" for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings.");
		MovieReview JohnWick =  new MovieReview("John Wick", "An ex-hitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him.", "2014", "David Leitch, Chad Stahelski", "Action", 9943177L, "Mrwick.jpg", "Great revenge thriller that grabs you right by the collar after a few minutes and doesn't let go for the next action-packed 90 minutes. The violence is pretty graphic but very stylishly filmed, Reeves minimalist acting fits perfectly here, although he does show he's capable of much more in a couple of scenes. It's refreshing that amidst all the violence, the film does not take itself too seriously, introducing cool minor characters and despicable villains and just keeps delivering the action goods, driven by a fitting soundtrack. A highlight of the genre of recent years.");
